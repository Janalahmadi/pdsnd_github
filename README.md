### Explore US Bikeshare Data
The growing popularity of bicycle-sharing systems has been transforming urban transportation, enabling users to rent bicycles on a short-term basis. These systems leverage information technologies to streamline bike access and return, generating valuable data that can be used for usage pattern analysis. This project delves into bike-sharing usage patterns in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC, utilizing data provided by Motivate, a leading bike-sharing provider. 

Using Python and Statis to analyze bike share usage in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC, in order to obtain the following information:

#### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

#### 2 Popular stations and trip

* *most common start station
-most common end station
-most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#### 3 Trip duration

-total travel time
-average travel time

#### 4 User info

-counts of each user type
-counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
-earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
